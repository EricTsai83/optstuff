## Free Plan

Get started at no cost with generous limits for personal projects and prototyping.

| Resource | Monthly Limit |
|----------|---------------|
| Requests | 10,000 |
| Bandwidth | 1 GB |

### Default Rate Limits (per API Key)

| Limit | Default Value |
|-------|---------------|
| Per-minute | 60 requests |
| Per-day | 10,000 requests |

Rate limits are configurable per API key. See [Rate Limiting](/guides/rate-limiting) for tuning guidance.

## What Happens When You Exceed Limits

### Rate Limit Exceeded

When a single API key exceeds its per-minute or per-day limit, subsequent requests receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a `Retry-After` header indicating when to retry.

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "reason": "Too many requests per minute",
  "retryAfter": 12,
  "limit": 60
}
```

Other API keys on the same project are **not affected** — rate limits are enforced independently per key.

### Monthly Usage Exceeded

When your team's total monthly requests or bandwidth reaches the free plan limit:

- Existing cached responses continue to be served by CDNs
- New optimization requests may be throttled or rejected
- Usage resets at the start of each billing period
