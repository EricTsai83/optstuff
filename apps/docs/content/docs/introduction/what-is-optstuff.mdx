OptStuff is a secure, high-performance image optimization API designed for developers and teams who need to deliver optimized images at scale with fine-grained access control.

## What It Does

Point your image URLs through OptStuff's API endpoint, and it delivers optimized images with the right format, size, and quality — all controlled via URL parameters.

```

## Key Features

- **On-the-fly Optimization** — Resize, format conversion (WebP, AVIF), and quality adjustment via URL parameters
- **Signed URL Security** — HMAC-SHA256 signatures prevent unauthorized access
- **Multi-tenant Architecture** — Teams → Projects → API Keys hierarchy
- **Domain Whitelisting** — Control allowed image sources and referer domains
- **Encrypted Key Storage** — AES-256-GCM encryption for API keys at rest
- **Rate Limiting** — Configurable per-minute and per-day limits per API key
- **Usage Analytics** — Request logs, bandwidth tracking, and top images statistics

## Use Cases

| Scenario | How OptStuff Helps |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Web Applications** | Serve appropriately sized images for different screens; convert to modern formats (WebP, AVIF) |
| **Content Delivery** | Integrate with your CDN for edge-cached, optimized images |
| **E-commerce** | Thumbnail generation, zoom-ready images, consistent catalog dimensions |
| **User-Generated Content** | Resize, compress, and convert user uploads to web-friendly formats |

## How It Works

1. **Create a Project** — Set up a project in the dashboard
2. **Generate an API Key** — Get your public/secret key pair
3. **Sign URLs** — Use the secret key to sign image request URLs server-side
4. **Make Requests** — Send signed requests to the OptStuff API
5. **Get Optimized Images** — Receive optimized images with caching headers
