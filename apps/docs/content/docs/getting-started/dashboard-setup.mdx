description: How to create teams, projects, and API keys in the OptStuff dashboard.

This guide walks you through setting up your OptStuff dashboard — from team creation to managing API keys.

## Overview

The setup flow takes about 2 minutes:

```text
Sign In → Create Team → Create Project → Copy API Keys → Start Integrating
```

## Creating a Team

When you first sign in, you'll be redirected to the onboarding page to create your **personal team**.

1. Enter a **team name** (a suggestion is pre-filled from your profile)
2. Choose a **team slug** — the URL identifier (e.g., `optstuff.com/my-team`)
   - 3–50 characters, lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
   - Must be globally unique
3. Click **Create Team**

You'll be redirected to your new team dashboard.

> Your personal team cannot be deleted. You can create additional teams later for different organizations.

## Creating a Project

From the team dashboard:

1. Click **Create Project**
2. Fill in:
   - **Project Name** (required)
   - **Description** (optional)
   - **Image Sources** — which domains host your original images (e.g., `images.unsplash.com`, `cdn.mysite.com`). Subdomains are included automatically.
   - **Authorized Websites** (optional) — which websites can display optimized images. Leave empty to allow all.
3. Click **Create**

A **default API key** is generated automatically with your new project.

### Copying Your Keys

After project creation, a success dialog displays both keys together in `.env` format with a single copy button:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Project Created!                        │
│                                                      │
│  ⚠ Copy and add these to your .env file before      │
│     closing. The secret key is only shown once.      │
│                                                      │
│  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES              [Show] │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐ [Copy]  │
│  │ OPTSTUFF_SECRET_KEY="sk_••••••••••••"  │         │
│  │ OPTSTUFF_PUBLIC_KEY="pk_abc123def456"  │         │
│  └────────────────────────────────────────┘         │
│                                                      │
│              [Done]                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **One-click copy** — the copy button copies both keys with their environment variable names, ready to paste into your `.env` file
- **Secret Key** (`OPTSTUFF_SECRET_KEY`) — masked by default, with show/hide toggle
- **Public Key** (`OPTSTUFF_PUBLIC_KEY`) — always visible

> **The secret key is only shown once.** Copy and add the environment variables to your `.env` file before closing the dialog.

The dialog is locked during this step — you cannot close it accidentally.

## Managing API Keys

Navigate to your project's **API Keys** tab to see your API keys listed in a table:

### Create an API Key

1. Click **Create API Key**
2. Fill in:
   - **Key Name** (required) — e.g., "Production", "Development"
   - **Expiration** (optional) — automatic invalidation date (30 days, 90 days, etc.)
3. Click **Create Key**
4. Copy the secret key from the success screen

Image source restrictions are configured at the project level in **Settings → Domain Security**, not per API key.

### Rotate a Key

Rotation atomically **revokes the old key** and **creates a new one** with the same settings. Use this when a key may have been compromised.

1. Click the **Rotate** action on an API key
2. Copy the new secret key
3. Update your environment variables and redeploy

### Revoke a Key

Revocation immediately disables a key. All requests using it will be rejected.

1. Click the **Revoke** action on an API key
2. Confirm the action

## Project Tabs

Each project has five tabs:

| Tab | What You'll Find |
|-----|-----------------|
| **Overview** | API endpoint, setup checklist, usage summary |
| **API Keys** | API key list, create/rotate/revoke keys |
| **Usage** | Daily charts, bandwidth savings, top images, request logs |
| **Developer** | Code snippets, URL tester, integration examples |
| **Settings** | Project info, domain security (image sources + authorized websites), project deletion |

## Configuring Domain Security

From your project's **Settings** tab, the **Domain Security** section lets you configure both:

- **Image Sources** — which domains host the original images you want to optimize
- **Authorized Websites** — which websites can display your optimized images

See [Domain Whitelisting](/guides/domain-whitelisting) for details.
