This guide walks you through getting your first optimized image from OptStuff.

## Prerequisites

- An OptStuff account ([sign up here](https://optstuff.vercel.app))
- Node.js 18+ (for the signing example)

## 1. Create a Team and Project

After signing in, you'll be guided to create a **personal team**. Then create your first **project** from the dashboard — a default API key is generated automatically.

> See [Dashboard Setup](/docs/getting-started/dashboard-setup) for detailed UI instructions.

## 2. Copy Your Keys

After project creation, a success screen displays your keys:

- **Public Key** (`pk_...`) — identifies requests in URLs
- **Secret Key** (`sk_...`) — signs URLs server-side

> **Copy the secret key now.** It is only shown once.

## 3. Sign Your First URL

Create a file called `sign.mjs`:

```javascript
import { createHmac } from "crypto";

const SECRET_KEY = "sk_your_secret_key"; // ← replace
const PUBLIC_KEY = "pk_your_public_key"; // ← replace
const PROJECT_SLUG = "your-project-slug"; // ← replace
const ENDPOINT = "https://your-optstuff-deployment.com/api/v1";

const operations = "w_400,f_webp";
const imageUrl = "images.unsplash.com/photo-1506744038136-46273834b3fb";
const path = `${operations}/${imageUrl}`;

const signature = createHmac("sha256", SECRET_KEY)
  .update(path)
  .digest("base64url")
  .substring(0, 32);

const url = `${ENDPOINT}/${PROJECT_SLUG}/${path}?key=${PUBLIC_KEY}&sig=${signature}`;

console.log(url);
```

Run it:

```bash
node sign.mjs
```

## 4. Open the URL

Paste the output URL in your browser. You should see the image resized to 400px width and converted to WebP format.
