### Unified Domain Configuration

- **Breaking Change:** `allowedSourceDomains` (Image Sources) has been moved from per-API-key to project level. Both **Image Sources** and **Authorized Websites** (referer domains) are now configured in the project's **Settings → Domain Security** tab.
- API keys are simplified to name, expiration, and rate limits — domain restrictions are no longer per-key.
- Existing per-key source domain configurations have been migrated to their respective projects.
