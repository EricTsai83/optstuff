---

OptStuff is a secure, high-performance image optimization API that transforms images on-the-fly with URL-based operations, signed URL security, and multi-tenant access control.

## Quick Example

Turn any image into an optimized, resized WebP — with one signed URL:

```text
GET /api/v1/my-blog/w_800,q_80,f_webp/cdn.example.com/photo.jpg?key=pk_...&sig=...
```

Generate it server-side in a few lines:

```typescript
import { signImageUrl } from "@/lib/optstuff";

const url = signImageUrl("cdn.example.com/photo.jpg", "w_800,q_80,f_webp", 86400);
```
