title: Rate Limiting
description: How OptStuff rate limiting works — sliding window algorithm, dual-layer limits, configuration, response format, and tuning recommendations.

Rate limiting protects your account from abuse and unexpected costs. Each API key has independent rate limits, enforced globally across all server instances.

## Dual-Layer Limits

Every request is checked against two independent limits. Both must pass.

| Layer | Default | Window | Purpose |
|-------|---------|--------|---------|
| Per-day | 10,000 requests | 24 hours | Catch sustained overuse |
| Per-minute | 60 requests | 1 minute | Catch sudden bursts |

## Algorithm: Sliding Window

Unlike fixed windows that can allow up to 2× burst at boundaries, the sliding window algorithm produces smooth limits:

```text
Fixed Window (problem at boundary):
  Window 1 [11:00 – 11:01]          Window 2 [11:01 – 11:02]
           ... 0 req ... 59 req  │  60 req ...
                                 ↑
                          119 requests in ~1 second

Sliding Window (smooth):
  At 11:01:15 (25% into current window):
  Previous window count = 42
  Current window count  = 18
  Weighted count = 42 × 0.75 + 18 = 49.5 → under limit
```

## Configuration

Rate limits are stored per API key in the database:

| Setting | Range | Default |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `rateLimitPerMinute` | 1 – 10,000 | 60 |
| `rateLimitPerDay` | 1 – 1,000,000 | 10,000 |

New API keys are created with the default limits. Custom per-key rate limits are not yet configurable through the dashboard UI — this feature is planned for a future release. If you need to adjust limits, modify the database directly; changes take effect within 60 seconds (cache TTL).

## Response When Rate Limited

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "reason": "Too many requests per minute",
  "retryAfter": 12,
  "limit": 60
}
```

HTTP headers:

```text
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 12
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
```

Clients should respect the `Retry-After` header to avoid further 429 responses.

## Tuning Recommendations

| Traffic Level | Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------|
| Low (< 100 req/day) | Defaults work well |
| Medium (100 – 10,000 req/day) | Monitor analytics; increase per-day limit if hit legitimately |
| High (> 10,000 req/day) | Set per-key limits based on expected traffic to avoid false 429s |

## Design Notes

- Rate limits are checked **after** signature verification so that unauthenticated requests cannot exhaust quota.
- The per-day limit is checked **before** the per-minute limit to minimize token waste (see [Redis Schema](/docs/internal/redis-schema) for details).
